# TEAM

The Taxonomy for ETL Automation Metadata (TEAM) is a tool for design metadata management, geared towards data warehouse automation use-cases. It is part of the 'engine' for data warehouse automation, alongside the Virtual Data Warehouse pattern manager and the generic schema for Data Warehouse Automation.

## Way of working

Please report any bugs or issues as 'issues' in this Github. These issues will then be grouped into projects, for which I am creating a separate branch for each release.

Once tested, the branch is merged and a new development branch is started for the next planned release.
